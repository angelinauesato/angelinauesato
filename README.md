## Hi there, I'm Angelina! 👋

### Data Developer & Analytics Engineer | Specialist in Snowflake, Databricks, and Modern Data Stack Orchestration.

I build reliable data systems that bridge the gap between messy raw data and actionable business intelligence.
My focus is on the **Modern Data Stack** and implementing **Medallion Architecture** patterns.

## 🚀 Featured Project
### [UK Fuel Prices Data Pipeline](https://github.com/angelinauesato/uk_gas_prices)

A production-grade pipeline designed to track and model fuel prices across the UK.

- **Ingestion:** Scrapes data from multiple retailer APIs using **Apache Spark**.
- **Orchestration:** Fully managed via **Apache Airflow** with custom retry policies and failure alerts.
- **Modeling:** Implements **SCD Type 2** (Slowly Changing Dimensions) using **dbt** to maintain historical price accuracy.
- **Testing:** Automated data quality and referential integrity checks.

## ❄️ [Snowflake TPC-H Analytics Warehouse](https://github.com/angelinauesato/TPCH_Sample_Snowflake)
A containerized ELT pipeline transforming raw TPC-H data into business-ready Marts.

- **Orchestration:** Leveraged Astronomer Cosmos to render dbt models as native Airflow tasks for granular monitoring.

- **Architecture:** Implemented a three-layer structure (Staging, Intermediate, Marts) with dynamic schema generation via custom dbt macros.

- **Data Governance:** Automated 15+ data quality tests and persisted technical metadata (primary keys/descriptions) directly to Snowflake.

- **Observability:** Integrated custom failure callbacks for real-time alerting.
